Image Magnification

Changes Made During Development
- created one big rectangle using the get function
- made an embedded for loop to create a grid of rectangles
- Made it so that the minimum rectangle size is 2 by 2
- Centered the sampled grid around the mouse cursor by iterating from -50 to 50
- Created the illusion of zooming in by adjusting the rectangle size via scrolling
- The rectangles can cover the screen.
- Implementing a mask where the rectangles are all drawn to
- Implementing a circular mask where my mask containing rectangles will be masked to.
- Created a transparent ellipse with a thick outline to illustrate the zoomed in region.

- Would like to implement a text stating the zoom level.
